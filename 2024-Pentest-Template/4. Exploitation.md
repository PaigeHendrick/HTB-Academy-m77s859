# Penetration Testing Report: Exploitation

## 1. **Overview of Exploitation**
The exploitation phase involves leveraging identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges within the target environment. This phase is critical for demonstrating the real-world impact of vulnerabilities.

### **Objectives:**
- Validate the existence of identified vulnerabilities.
- Gain access to systems or data.
- Assess the potential for further exploitation and lateral movement.

## 2. **Exploitation Methodology**
The exploitation process was carried out using a combination of automated tools and manual techniques. The following steps were taken:

1. **Preparation:**
   - Review of vulnerability findings from the previous phase.
   - Selection of appropriate exploitation techniques based on identified vulnerabilities.

2. **Execution:**
   - Conducted exploitation attempts using tools and custom scripts.
   - Documented success and failure of each exploitation attempt.

3. **Post-Exploitation:**
   - Evaluated the extent of access gained and potential for lateral movement.
   - Identified sensitive data and other assets accessible post-exploitation.

### **Detailed Exploitation Analysis:**

#### 1. **CVE-2021-34527**
- **Target:** `192.168.1.10`
- **Method Used:** Metasploit framework
- **Access Gained:** Remote command execution
- **Impact:** Gained full control of the web server, allowing further actions such as deploying malware or exfiltrating sensitive data.

#### 2. **CVE-2021-45046**
- **Target:** `192.168.1.20`
- **Method Used:** SQLMap
- **Access Gained:** SQL query execution
- **Impact:** Retrieved sensitive data, including user credentials and personal information stored in the database.

#### 3. **Open Redirect**
- **Target:** `192.168.1.10`
- **Method Used:** Manual exploitation
- **Access Gained:** Redirected users to a malicious site
- **Impact:** Created a potential phishing vector that could be exploited for credential harvesting.

#### 4. **Weak Password Policy**
- **Target:** `192.168.1.20`
- **Method Used:** Brute force attack
- **Access Gained:** Compromised MySQL database with default or weak passwords
- **Impact:** Gained access to the database, potentially allowing data manipulation or extraction.

## 5. **Conclusion**
The exploitation phase demonstrated that several identified vulnerabilities could be successfully leveraged to gain access to critical systems and data. Immediate remediation actions are recommended to mitigate the risks associated with these vulnerabilities.

### **Next Steps:**
- Move to the Post-Exploitation phase to assess the extent of access and further evaluate the potential for lateral movement and data exfiltration.
