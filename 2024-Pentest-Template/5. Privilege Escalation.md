# Penetration Testing Report: Privilege Escalation

## 1. **Overview of Privilege Escalation**
Privilege escalation is a critical phase in penetration testing where an attacker attempts to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from user-level access. This phase is essential for understanding the potential impact of vulnerabilities and the overall security posture of the system.

### **Objectives:**
- Identify potential vectors for privilege escalation.
- Gain higher levels of access within the system.
- Document methods used and access gained.

## 2. **Privilege Escalation Methodology**
The methodology for privilege escalation involved reviewing system configurations, permissions, and previously identified vulnerabilities. The following steps were taken:

1. **Preparation:**
   - Analyze access levels gained during exploitation.
   - Identify potential misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.

2. **Execution:**
   - Conducted attempts to escalate privileges using various techniques and tools.
   - Documented the success or failure of each attempt.

3. **Post-Exploitation:**
   - Assessed the implications of gained privileges on the target system.
   - Identified sensitive data and potential lateral movement opportunities.

## 3. **Techniques Used for Privilege Escalation**

| **Technique**          | **Description**                                       | **Tools/Commands**                       |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Kernel Exploits**    | Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the operating system kernel. | `searchsploit`, `Metasploit`            |
| **SUID/SGID Binaries** | Identifying binaries with SUID/SGID permissions that can be exploited. | `find / -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 -type f` |
| **Misconfigured Services** | Exploiting misconfigured services or applications that run with elevated privileges. | `systemctl`, `ps aux`                   |
| **Password Reuse**     | Utilizing weak or reused passwords to gain elevated access. | `hashcat`, `John the Ripper`            |
| **Credential Harvesting** | Extracting sensitive credentials from memory or configuration files. | `mimikatz`, `cat`, `grep`               |

## 4. **Findings from Privilege Escalation**

### **Summary of Successful Escalation Attempts:**

| **Target**            | **Method Used**          | **Access Gained**                     | **Impact**                               |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `192.168.1.10`       | SUID Binary Exploit      | Root access                           | Full control over the target system     |
| `192.168.1.20`       | Kernel Exploit            | Elevated privileges                   | Ability to modify system files and settings |
| `192.168.1.10`       | Misconfigured Service     | Administrative access                 | Access to critical application settings  |

### **Detailed Privilege Escalation Analysis:**

#### 1. **SUID Binary Exploit**
- **Target:** `192.168.1.10`
- **Method Used:** Exploited a SUID binary (e.g., `/usr/bin/example_suid`)
- **Access Gained:** Gained root access
- **Impact:** Full control over the server, allowing further attacks or data manipulation.

#### 2. **Kernel Exploit**
- **Target:** `192.168.1.20`
- **Method Used:** Utilized a kernel exploit (e.g., `CVE-2021-3156`)
- **Access Gained:** Elevated privileges to root
- **Impact:** Ability to execute arbitrary commands as root and compromise the entire system.

#### 3. **Misconfigured Service**
- **Target:** `192.168.1.10`
- **Method Used:** Exploited a misconfigured service running with elevated privileges (e.g., a web service running as root)
- **Access Gained:** Administrative access to the application
- **Impact:** Access to critical application configurations and sensitive data.

## 5. **Conclusion**
The privilege escalation phase demonstrated that multiple methods could be used to gain elevated access on the target systems. Immediate remediation actions should be taken to mitigate these vulnerabilities and prevent unauthorized access.

### **Next Steps:**
- Move to the Reporting phase to document all findings and recommendations for securing the environment.
