# Penetration Testing Report: Privilege Escalation

## 1. **Overview of Privilege Escalation**
Privilege escalation is a critical phase in penetration testing where an attacker attempts to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from user-level access. This phase is essential for understanding the potential impact of vulnerabilities and the overall security posture of the system.

### **Objectives:**
- Identify potential vectors for privilege escalation.
- Gain higher levels of access within the system.
- Document methods used and access gained.

## 2. **Privilege Escalation Methodology**
The methodology for privilege escalation involved reviewing system configurations, permissions, and previously identified vulnerabilities. The following steps were taken:

1. **Preparation:**
   - Analyze access levels gained during exploitation.
   - Identify potential misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.

2. **Execution:**
   - Conducted attempts to escalate privileges using various techniques and tools.
   - Documented the success or failure of each attempt.

3. **Post-Exploitation:**
   - Assessed the implications of gained privileges on the target system.
   - Identified sensitive data and potential lateral movement opportunities.

## 3. **Example Techniques Used for Privilege Escalation**

| **Technique**          | **Description**                                       | **Tools/Commands**                       |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Kernel Exploits**    | Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the operating system kernel. | `searchsploit`, `Metasploit`            |
| **SUID/SGID Binaries** | Identifying binaries with SUID/SGID permissions that can be exploited. | `find / -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 -type f` |
| **Misconfigured Services** | Exploiting misconfigured services or applications that run with elevated privileges. | `systemctl`, `ps aux`                   |
| **Password Reuse**     | Utilizing weak or reused passwords to gain elevated access. | `hashcat`, `John the Ripper`            |
| **Credential Harvesting** | Extracting sensitive credentials from memory or configuration files. | `mimikatz`, `cat`, `grep`               |

### Summary of Successful Escalation Attempts

| **Target**    | **Method Used**      | **Access Gained**     | **Impact**                                     |
| ------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `10.10.16.52` | Full Root Access     | Root access           | Complete control over the target system        |
| `10.10.16.52` | Privilege Escalation | Elevated privileges   | Unauthorized access to sensitive data          |
| `10.10.16.52` | Ease of Exploitation | Root access           | Low-skill requirement for exploitation         |
| `10.10.16.52` | Web Exploits         | Remote code execution | Compromise of the web server and network pivot |

### Detailed Privilege Escalation Analysis:

#### 1. **Full Root Access**
- **Target:** `10.10.16.52`
- **Method Used:** Executed PHP scripts with elevated privileges via `sudo /usr/bin/php` without requiring a password.
- **Access Gained:** Spawned a root shell, allowing full control over the system.
- **Impact:** Complete system takeover, allowing an attacker to modify or delete critical files and settings.

#### 2. **Privilege Escalation**
- **Target:** `10.10.16.52`
- **Method Used:** Leveraged PHPâ€™s ability to execute system commands as root.
- **Access Gained:** Gained root-level privileges from a lower-privileged user (`www-data`).
- **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data and unrestricted control over system resources.

#### 3. **Ease of Exploitation**
- **Target:** `10.10.16.52`
- **Method Used:** No password was required due to the `NOPASSWD` setting in `sudo`, making the attack trivial.
- **Access Gained:** Simple PHP script execution allowed privilege escalation and full root access.
- **Impact:** Low-skill requirement for exploitation; attacker can easily control the system with minimal effort.

#### 4. **Web Exploits**
- **Target:** `10.10.16.52`
- **Method Used:** Compromised a web application running as `www-data` to execute arbitrary PHP code.
- **Access Gained:** Remote code execution allowed the attacker to leverage the PHP interpreter and escalate privileges to root.
- **Impact:** Remote attackers could fully compromise the web server and use it as a pivot point for further network exploitation.


## 5. **Conclusion**
The privilege escalation phase demonstrated that multiple methods could be used to gain elevated access on the target systems. Immediate remediation actions should be taken to mitigate these vulnerabilities and prevent unauthorized access.

### **Next Steps:**
- Move to the Reporting phase to document all findings and recommendations for securing the environment.
