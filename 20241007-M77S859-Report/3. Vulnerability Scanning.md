## **Overview:**

Vulnerability scanning is a critical phase in penetration testing that involves identifying known vulnerabilities in systems, applications, and networks. Automated tools are employed to streamline the scanning process and provide an initial assessment of the security posture.

### **Objectives:**

- Identify vulnerabilities in target systems and applications.
- Classify vulnerabilities based on their severity.
- Document findings for further analysis and remediation.

## 2. **Tools Used for Vulnerability Scanning**

|**Tool**|**Description**|**Purpose**|
|---|---|---|
|**Nessus**|Comprehensive vulnerability scanner|Automated scanning for a wide range of vulnerabilities|
|**OpenVAS**|Open-source vulnerability scanner|Vulnerability scanning with customizable reporting|
|**Nikto**|Web server scanner|Identifies vulnerabilities in web applications|
|**Burp Suite**|Web application security testing tool|Manual and automated testing for web vulnerabilities|
|**Qualys**|Cloud-based vulnerability management|Continuous monitoring and assessment|

## 3. **Vulnerability Scanning Process**

The vulnerability scanning process involved the following steps:

1. **Preparation:**
    
    - Define scan scope based on reconnaissance findings.
    - Configure the tools for targeted scanning.
2. **Execution:**
    
    - Conducted scans using automated tools and documented the results.
    - Performed manual validation of critical findings.
3. **Analysis:**
    
    - Review scan results and categorize vulnerabilities.
    - Assess the impact and risk associated with each vulnerability.
