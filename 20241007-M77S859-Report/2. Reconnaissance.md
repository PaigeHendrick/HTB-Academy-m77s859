# Penetration Testing Report: Reconnaissance
## 1. **Overview of Reconnaissance:

Reconnaissance is the first phase of the penetration testing process. It involves gathering information about the target environment to identify potential vulnerabilities. This phase is crucial as it sets the foundation for subsequent testing activities.

### **Objectives:**

- Identify live hosts, services, and open ports.
- Gather information on domain names, subdomains, and associated technologies.
- Collect any available data through open-source intelligence (OSINT).

## 2. **Passive Reconnaissance**

Passive reconnaissance involves collecting information without directly interacting with the target systems. This can help avoid detection and is often conducted using publicly available resources. 

### **Techniques and Tools Used:**

| **Technique**      | **Description**                                                                 | **Tools Used**                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| OSINT Gathering    | Gathering information from public sources (e.g., search engines, social media). | `Google`, `Shodan`, `theHarvester` |
| Domain Information | Finding domain registration details, DNS records.                               | `Whois`, `Dig`, `nslookup`         |
| Network Mapping    | Identifying IP addresses, subdomains, and network structure.                    | `Netcraft`, `Censys`               |

### **Findings from Passive Recon:**

| **Source**          | **Data Collected**                                         |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Domain Registration | Not Applicable - Internal Network Application              |
| DNS Records         | Not Applicable - Requires /etc/host for domain name access |
| Subdomains          | None                                                       |

## 3. **Active Reconnaissance**

Active reconnaissance involves directly interacting with the target system to gather more detailed information. This can include network scanning and probing services.

### **Techniques and Tools Used:**

|**Technique**|**Description**|**Tools Used**|
|---|---|---|
|Port Scanning|Identifying open ports and services running on the target systems.|`Nmap`, `Masscan`|
|Service Enumeration|Determining the version and configuration of services running on open ports.|`Nmap`, `Netcat`|
|OS Fingerprinting|Identifying the operating system running on target hosts.|`Nmap`, `p0f`|

### **Findings from Active Recon:**


| **Target**    | **Open Ports**       | **Services Detected**      | **OS Fingerprint** |
| ------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `10.10.16.52` | 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), | OpenSSH 8.0, Apache 2.4.41 | Linux              |

| **Target**    | **Application** | **Version** |
| ------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| `10.10.16.52` | GetSimple CMS   | 3.3.15      |

## 4. **Network Mapping**

Network mapping helps visualize the targetâ€™s network architecture and understand how different systems are interconnected. Tools like `Nmap` can also be used for this purpose.

### **Network Map Overview:**

## 5. **Conclusion**

The reconnaissance phase successfully gathered valuable information about the target environment. The findings from passive and active reconnaissance will guide further testing phases, helping to identify potential vulnerabilities effectively.

### **Next Steps:**

- Move on to the Vulnerability Scanning phase to identify potential weaknesses based on the information gathered.
