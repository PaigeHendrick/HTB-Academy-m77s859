| External Web Application | URL: `https://example.com` (Hosted on AWS)        | Yes           |
| Database                 | MySQL (Backend for the Web Application)           | Yes           |
| Cloud Infrastructure     | AWS (S3 Buckets, IAM Roles, EC2 Instances)        | Yes           |
| APIs                     | External APIs used by the web application         | Yes           |
| Third-party Integrations | External services integrated with the application | No            |
| Social Engineering       | Phishing or pretexting                            | No            |
| Physical Security        | Physical entry to on-site systems                 | No            |

### **Out of Scope:**

- Social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, pretexting).
- Physical security testing.
- Any third-party or vendor systems.

## 4. **Tools and Technologies Used**

|**Category**|**Tools Used**|**Purpose**|
|---|---|---|
|**Reconnaissance**|`Nmap`, `theHarvester`, `Whois`|Network mapping, OSINT, DNS enumeration|
|**Vulnerability Scanning**|`Nessus`, `Nikto`, `OpenVAS`|Automated vulnerability scanning|
|**Exploitation**|`Metasploit`, `SQLMap`, `Burp Suite`|Exploiting discovered vulnerabilities|
|**Privilege Escalation**|`LinPEAS`, `WinPEAS`|Checking for local privilege escalation opportunities|
|**Post-Exploitation**|`Mimikatz`, `BloodHound`, `Empire`|Credential harvesting, Active Directory enumeration|

## 5. **Testing Methodology**

The test was conducted following industry-standard penetration testing methodologies, ensuring both coverage and consistency. The process followed is broken down into phases below:

|**Phase**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**Reconnaissance**|Passive and active information gathering using OSINT, network scans, and DNS lookups.|
|**Vulnerability Scanning**|Automated vulnerability scanning and manual validation of findings.|
|**Exploitation**|Targeting and exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access or escalate privileges.|
|**Post-Exploitation**|Evaluating potential for persistence, lateral movement, and sensitive data extraction.|
|**Reporting**|Documenting findings, assigning risk levels, and providing remediation advice.|

### **Risk Classification**

The following table outlines the risk classification used to categorize the severity of identified vulnerabilities:

|**Risk Level**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**Low**|Minimal impact or hard-to-exploit issue, with little potential for damage.|
|**Medium**|Exploitable, but requires specific conditions. Impact is moderate.|
|**High**|Easily exploitable vulnerability that could lead to significant security risks.|
|**Critical**|Immediate, severe risk, capable of compromising critical systems or data.|
