## Basics
This is a public repo for me to share my practice pentest reports that I create using my HTB labs and templates used for those reports. 

I'm still improving my note taking skills so I'm sure my templates will change over time as I figure out how to best organize my findings. 

I use Obsidian on my machine to organize my notes while I'm working, as such image mappings may not render as expected initially, I plan to update the linkage down the road as I finalize the report to ensure they render as expected.
